See Indicator Example for more details regarding this.<br>  We also provide a way for you to verify the authenticity of the indicator via a signature. Please see Verifying Indicators for details.\n</p><strong>What are Webhooks?</strong>\n<p>A webhook is an HTTP-based callback that allows MarketRaker's API to send real-time data to your application as soon as an indicator is generated. Unlike traditional polling mechanisms that periodically request data, webhooks are event-driven, meaning that our API pushes the notification to your application when a new indicator is generated.</p><strong>Integration Example:</strong><br><p>For an example of how to integrate your trading bot with our webhook service, see our: <p class=\"centre\"><a href='https://github.com/MarketRaker/trading-bot-example-code'>GitHub example</a></p></p>",
