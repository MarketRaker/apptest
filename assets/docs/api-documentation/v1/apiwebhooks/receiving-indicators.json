This is essentially an IP address or URL that is capable of receiving HTTP requests from our system.</p><p>For example, you could configure an endpoint like: <br><code>http://my-trading-bot/marketraker-webhooks</code><br> Your server should also be prepared to accept incoming POST requests containing data. This endpoint will act as a listener for incoming webhook notifications, allowing you to process the data and integrate it with your application or trading bot in real time.\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Items needed for receiving indicators:</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>A <a href='#/integrations/api-channel'> registered</a> and active webhook.</li>\n      <li>A server capable of receiving POST requests containing Data.</li>\n      <li>At least 10 000 raker tokens.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Examples:</strong> Below are example of how to receive an indicator:\n  <ol><li><pre><code>from fastapi import Request, HTTPException<br><br>async def webhook_endpoint(request: Request):<br>    try:<br><br>     payload:dict = await request.json()<br>     return payload<br><br>    except Exception as e:<br>     print(f'Error processing webhook: {e}')<br>     raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail='Internal server error')</code></pre></li>\n <li>Look at our <a href='https://github.com/MarketRaker/trading-bot-example-code'>Indicator Integration</a> GitHub example.</li></ol>\n   </li>\n  \n</ol>",
