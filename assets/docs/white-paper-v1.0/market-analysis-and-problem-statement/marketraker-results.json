The purpose of the simulation was to assess the performance of the indicators in identifying profitable trading opportunities and to validate the effectiveness of the model in managing risk.</p><p>The results of the simulation period will be published as soon as we are comfortable that the results are sound, providing an objective and quantitative analysis of the model's performance. Our aim is to have the results verified by a trusted 3rd party as well.</p><p>MarketRaker AI recognises the importance of real-world performance and understands that simulation results may not always reflect actual trading outcomes. Therefore, while the simulation results provide valuable insights, users are encouraged to consider their own risk tolerance and market conditions when making trading decisions.</p>",
