This token is built on the Cardano blockchain, leveraging its superior speed, security, and efficiency. RAKER token plays a central role in the MarketRaker AI ecosystem, being used as an indicator of how much access you have to MarketRaker AI.</p><h2>Explanation of the MarketRaker AI token</h2><p>The MarketRaker AI token, known as <strong>RAKER</strong>, is a critical component of the MarketRaker AI ecosystem. It serves multiple roles, primarily providing access to the innovative MarketRaker AI platform, its extensive suite of trading tools, and the associated community.</p><p>Built on the Cardano blockchain, RAKER functions as a utility token, encapsulating a unique subscription model. The number of RAKER tokens a user holds determines their subscription duration to the platform and its services. Holding 10 RAKER tokens is equivalent to one month's access, and 120 tokens provide access for a year, and so forth. This system ensures that only active participants of the MarketRaker AI ecosystem can benefit from its services, promoting a dynamic and engaged user base.</p><p>For users seeking long-term engagement, holding 1,000 RAKER tokens provides unlimited access to the platform and its current features. Moreover, it also grants access to all future features, keeping these users at the forefront of MarketRaker AI's evolution.</p><p>In addition, holding a RAKER token offers exclusive membership to the MarketRaker AI Discord community. This allows users to connect with a network of traders and the MarketRaker AI team, enhancing their trading experience with shared insights and discussions.</p><p>The distribution of RAKER tokens also extends to the founding MarketRaker AI team. Ten wallets, each holding 50,000 RAKER tokens, are allocated to core team members, aligning their interests with the platform's success.</p><p>The distribution of RAKER tokens also extends to the long-term MarketRaker AI team member. One hundred wallets, each holding 10,000 RAKER tokens, are allocated to long-term team members, aligning their interests with the platform's success.</p><p>RAKER also serves a pivotal role in funding the platform's development. By selling 10,000 tokens each week over four years, from the day after our first 500 users subscribed, MarketRaker AI secures resources for ongoing feature enhancements and sustainable growth.</p><p>Finally, as a reward to early adopters, the first 500 users holding at least 10 RAKER tokens will receive an airdrop of 1,000 RAKER tokens, strengthening the early user community.</p><p>It's essential to understand that RAKER, while central to accessing and interacting with MarketRaker AI's platform and services, is not an investment vehicle. It's a utility token designed to provide access to MarketRaker AI's tools and facilitate an active, collaborative trading community, and let the community decide what is the value worth accessing MarketRaker AI.</p><p>You might be asking, why no testnet for ADA? It's straightforward: MarketRaker AI only checks RAKER token holdings without requiring direct interaction with the blockchain. This means we can deliver a seamless experience without the need for a separate testnet phase.</p>"
